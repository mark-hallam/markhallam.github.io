# DAC — Declarative Agent Compilation

A context engineering methodology that compiles human intent into autonomous AI agent execution plans with intelligent model routing, effort-aware dispatch, and fully autonomous phase progression.

**Two messages to compile. One command to execute. Zero stops in between.**

## What Is DAC?

DAC treats AI coding agents as compilation targets, not conversational partners. You describe a project, answer one decision batch, and the methodology compiles everything — CLAUDE.md, execution map, conflict matrix, cost estimate, session packages, and launch command — in a single response. Claude Code then dispatches sessions as parallel subagents, cascading through execution layers autonomously.

## Version 3.0

DAC v3.0 (February 2026) is tuned for Claude Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6. Key features:

- **Model-Tier Routing** — Opus for foundation/integration, Sonnet for independent features at 40% lower cost
- **Effort-Aware Dispatch** — max/high/medium/low effort levels per session
- **Autonomous Phase Progression** — all phases compile in one response after the decision batch (fixes the #1 pain point from GYSOM v2)
- **Native Subagent Orchestration** — sessions dispatch as parallel subagents automatically
- **Cost Tracking** — per-session token estimates and total build cost
- **Conflict Matrix** — zero file collisions guaranteed before execution begins

## Lineage

DAC v3.0 evolved from GYSOM ("Get Your Skates On Mate"):

| Version | Name | Year | Key Innovation |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1.0 | GYSOM | 2025 | Prompt compilation, DAG decomposition, parallel session execution |
| v2.0 | GYSOM | 2026 | File manifests, checkpoint-and-resume, scoped git commits |
| v3.0 | DAC | 2026 | Model routing, effort-aware dispatch, autonomous orchestration, cost tracking |

The original GYSOM repositories are available at [github.com/mark-hallam/gysom](https://github.com/mark-hallam/gysom).

## Quick Start

1. Copy `DAC-v3.0-Personal-Preferences.md` contents into **Claude Desktop → Settings → Personal Preferences**
2. Copy `DAC-v3.0-Global-Instructions.md` contents into **Claude Desktop → Settings → Cowork → Global Instructions (EDIT)**
3. Open a new Cowork task and describe your project
4. Answer the decision batch
5. Open Claude Code and issue the launch command
